# Project_1

## Brainstorming/Questions

1) Did more crashes occur at a particular time of day and/or day of the week?
2) How much of a factor was weather and/or road condition on reported crashes?
3) Are there any particular streets that are more notorious than others for traffic accidents?
4) What do crashes look like over time?
5) Are crashes more common on roads with a particular posted speed limit? Road type?
6) How many pedestrian, pedalcyclist, animal, etc crashes resulted in injury?
7) Should we map all crashes or try to formulate a heat map? If we did, would it tell us anything?
